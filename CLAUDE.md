# SG Tracker — Claude Context

Mobile-first strokes gained tracker for golf, deployed as a single self-contained `index.html`. Built for iOS Safari (home screen web app).

## Build

```
python build.py
```

Reads `html/app.html`, resolves `<!-- INCLUDE: fragments/foo.html -->` directives, inlines all CSS and JS, stamps `<!-- BUILD_DATE -->`, writes `index.html` to the repo root.

**Never edit `index.html` directly** — it is a build artifact. All source edits go in the files below.

## File Structure

```

## Shot Data Model

Each shot stored in `round.holes[n].shots[]`:

```js
{
  lie: 'tee'|'fairway'|'rough'|'sand'|'recovery'|'green',
  distFrom: Number,                    // yards (feet if lie=green)
  resultLie: 'fairway'|'rough'|'sand'|'recovery'|'green'|'holed'|'penalty',
  resultDist: Number|null,             // yards (feet if resultLie=green); null if holed
  category: 'drive'|'approach'|'shortgame'|'putt',
  sg: Number|null,                     // strokes gained value
  missDepth: 'short'|'long'|null,
  missSide: 'left'|'middle'|'right'|null,  // OR 'low'|'center'|'high' for putts
}
```

## Key JS Patterns

### State
Single `state` object — never persisted, resets on page load:
```js
let state = { currentRoundId, currentHole, editingShotIndex, excludedCategories, shotLie, shotResultLie, shotCategory, shotMissDepth, shotMissSide }
```

### Storage
All data in `localStorage` as JSON. Keys: `sg_rounds`, `sg_courses`.

### Collapsed chip UI (Category, Starting Lie, Distance)
Category, Starting Lie, and Distance from Pin all use a chip-based collapsed pattern:
- A chip (`#category-chip`, `#lie-chip`, `#dist-chip`) shows the current value
- Pills/input expand inline on tap via `toggleCategoryOverride()` / `toggleLieOverride()` / `toggleDistOverride()`
- Selecting a pill updates the chip and auto-collapses via `silent=false` path in `selectCategory()` / `selectLie()`
- Distance chip updates on input via `onDistInput()` and on unit change via `updateDistFromUnit()`
- `renderCategoryChip(cat)`, `renderLieChip(lie)`, `renderDistChip(val, unit)` handle chip DOM updates
- Distance field no longer auto-focuses on sheet open — user taps chip to expand and focus

### Shot Pre-fill (getSuggestion)
`getSuggestion(holeData)` returns `{ lie, dist, hint }` for new shots:
- First shot on a hole → `lie:'tee'`, dist from scorecard
- Subsequent shots → previous shot's `resultLie` and `resultDist`
- The pre-filled distance is shown in the collapsed chip — no separate hint text

When `lie='green'`, `selectLie` also auto-sets `resultLie='green'` if no result lie is set yet.

### Miss Direction
- `selectMissDepth(val)` / `selectMissSide(val)` — toggle behavior (tap selected → deselects)
- Side options swap based on category: putts use Low/Center/High, all others use Left/Middle/Right
- `updateMissSidePills(cat)` rebuilds the side pills and is called from `selectCategory`
- Miss direction group is hidden when result is 'Holed', shown for all other results (including Penalty)

### Penalty Shots
`resultLie: 'penalty'` is a secondary result pill (alongside Sand and Recovery). Behavior:
- Result distance and miss direction are required/shown (same as any non-holed result)
- SG = `getExpected(startLie, startDist) - getExpected('rough', resultDist) - 2` — uses `rough` table as proxy for drop position, subtracts an extra stroke for the penalty
- Shows a red `+1 stroke` badge (`.penalty-badge`) in the shot list row
- `countStrokes(shots)` — helper that returns `shots.length + penalty count`; used everywhere strokes are displayed (home card, summary header, hole rows)
- No auto-fill for the next shot's lie (drop location varies), but result distance carries forward as the distance pre-fill
- `getSuggestion` returns `{ lie: null, dist }` after a penalty; `openShotSheet` guards `selectLie`/`selectCategory` with `if(sug.lie)`

### SG Calculation
`calcSG(startLie, startDist, resultLie, resultDist)` uses `sg_tables.js` lookup tables with linear interpolation. Result is added to each shot on save.

## CSS Conventions

Dark theme throughout. Key variables: `--sky` (bg), `--card`, `--sheet-bg`, `--fairway` (green accent), `--accent` (red), `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-dim`.

Pill variants:
- `.pill` — standard size, full color when `.selected`
- `.pill-sm` — smaller/dimmer for secondary lies (Sand, Recovery) and miss direction

Category badge colors: `.cat-drive` (gold), `.cat-approach` (green), `.cat-shortgame` (light green), `.cat-putt` (blue).

## Lie Hierarchy (UI)

Sand, Recovery, and Penalty are infrequent. In lie pill rows, they appear as secondary pills (`.pill-sm`, `.pill-group-secondary`) below the primary row:
- **Primary result lies**: Fairway · Rough · Green · Holed
- **Secondary result lies**: Sand · Recovery · Penalty
- **Primary starting lies**: Tee · Fairway · Rough · Green
- **Secondary starting lies**: Sand · Recovery

## Round Summary

`renderSummary()` builds two cards: `#summary-totals` and `#summary-holes`.

**summary-totals card:**
- Header row: Total SG + stroke count
- One row per category (Drive, Approach, Short Game, Putt) — tappable to expand
- `toggleSummaryCat(cat)` toggles the expand div (`#ssum-{cat}`) and rotates the `›` chevron (`#ssum-icon-{cat}`)
- Expanded rows show individual shots: `H1  Tee 385y · 235y drive › Fwy 150y Short-Left  +0.32`
  - Lie abbreviations: Tee, Fwy, Rgh, Sand, Rcv, Grn, Holed, Pen
  - Miss direction appended in `.ssum-miss` (10px, `--text-dim`) when recorded
  - Distance in `y` (yards) or `ft` (feet for green)
  - Drive shots include drive distance (`startDist - resultDist`) inline after starting distance in `.ssum-drive` (10px, `--text-dim`)

**summary-holes card:** one row per hole with hole number, par, stroke count, and total SG — tappable to expand.
- `toggleSummaryHole(holeNum)` toggles `#ssum-hole-{holeNum}` and rotates `#ssum-hole-icon-{holeNum}`
- Expanded rows use the same shot format as category drill-down, with category name (Drive/Approach/Short Game/Putt) as the label column instead of hole number — uses wider `.ssum-hole-cat` class (62px) to avoid overlap
- Drive distance shown the same way as in category drill-down

`buildShotRow(s, label, labelClass)` — shared helper used by both drill-downs to render a single shot row.

### Drive Distance (hole screen)
In `renderShotList`, Drive shots show drive distance inline on the main line: `Tee · 385 yds · 235 yds drive [Drive]`. Rendered in `.shot-drive-dist` (12px, `--text-dim`). Calculated as `distFrom - resultDist`.

Both use `countStrokes(shots)` for stroke totals (adds +1 per penalty shot).

## Screen Navigation

`showScreen(name)` — shows `#screen-{name}`, hides all others, calls the matching render function. Screens: `home`, `courses`, `hole`, `summary`.

The hole screen topbar uses a `⌂` home icon (`.btn-icon`) to navigate back to the home screen — intentionally distinct from the `‹ ›` hole navigation arrows.

## CSV Export

`exportCSV()` — full shot-level CSV with columns: Hole, Par, Yardage, Shot#, Lie, Dist From, Dist Unit, Result Lie, Result Dist, Result Unit, Category, SG, Miss Depth, Miss Side.

`exportSummaryCSV()` — one row per round with SG totals by category.

Both use a clipboard fallback modal for iOS Safari compatibility.

## Course Management

Courses screen shows each course as a card. Each card has two action buttons (rendered via `renderCourses`):
- **✎ edit** — calls `openCourseEdit(id)`, opens `#course-edit-sheet` with name + tees inputs
- **× delete** — calls `deleteCourse(id)`, shows `confirm()` dialog before deleting

Buttons use `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent triggering `startRound`.

### Course Edit Sheet (`sheet-course-edit.html`)
- Fields: Name, Tees
- Save: `saveCourseEdit()` — updates course in-place by id, closes sheet
- "Edit holes in JSON ›": `loadCourseHolesJSON()` — pre-fills the JSON import textarea with current course data and closes sheet; user edits and re-saves via existing JSON flow
- Overlay click to dismiss: `handleCourseEditOverlayClick(e)`
- Active course being edited stored in `editingCourseId` (module-level, not in `state`)

### JSON import (`saveCourseJSON`)
Updated to replace existing course if `c.id` matches an existing entry, rather than always pushing a new one. This supports the "edit holes in JSON" workflow.

### Data safety
Rounds store `courseName` at creation time — deleting a course does **not** affect existing round data.
